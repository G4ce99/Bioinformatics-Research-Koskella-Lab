# Bioinformatics-Research-Koskella-Lab
As a freshman and sophomore at UC Berkeley, I worked as a bioinformatician for the Koskella Lab. During my freshman year, I created a bioinformatics pipeline that constructs and annotates phage genomes from Illumina reads of their DNA. Additionally, I also created a program that mass annotates a folder of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae(Pss) bacteria genomes collected from our samples and the NCBI database and uses these annotations to construct an unrooted phylogenetic tree of this bacteria species As I head into my sophomore year, I am currently working to create a csv file with information about the phylogroup and plant host of all ~90 known Pss bacteria strains.
