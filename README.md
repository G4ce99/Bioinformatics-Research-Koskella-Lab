# Bioinformatics-Research-Koskella-Lab
During my first 5 semesters at UC Berkeley, I worked as a computer scientist and bioinformatician in Dr. Britt Koskella's lab. During my freshman year, I created a bioinformatics pipeline that constructs and annotates phage genomes from Illumina reads of their DNA. I conducted a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis on the results of the pipeline to determine if their were any mutations to consider when using them in tests or analysis. Additionally, I also created a program that mass annotates a dataset of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae(Pss) bacterial genomes that I curated from our lab samples and all know members of the species listed in NCBI's database. Afterwards, I used these annotations to construct an unrooted phylogenetic tree of this bacteria species to better understand the host range of our samples. Because we are currently in the process of publishing, the majority of my work is currently private; however, I hope to have this repo fully updated with all of my research code by December 2023. 

For more information about how I achieved both the phage genomic annotation pipeline/analysis and the phylogenetic analysis of the Pss bacterial species, check out the ReadMe's in the two folders above explaining the contents of the files used for each project. Because we have not published our work yet, file paths have been changed within the files to ensure the confidentiality of our work.
