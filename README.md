# Bioinformatics-Research-Koskella-Lab
As a freshman and sophomore at UC Berkeley, I worked as a computer scientist and bioinformatician in Dr. Britt Koskella's lab. During my freshman year, I created a bioinformatics pipeline that constructs and annotates phage genomes from Illumina reads of their DNA. Additionally, I also created a program that mass annotates a dataset of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae(Pss) bacterial genomes that I curated from our lab samples and all know members of the species listed in NCBI's database. Afterwards, I used these annotations to construct an unrooted phylogenetic tree of this bacteria species to better understand the host range of our samples. As I head into my sophomore year, I am currently working to create a csv file with information about the phylogroup and plant host of all ~90 known Pss bacteria strains in order to identify which plant hosts our bacteria infect. 

For more information about both the genomic annotation pipeline and the phylogenetic analysis, check out the ReadMe's in the two folders above containing the code I used for each project. Because we have not published our work yet, file paths have been changed to ensure the confidentiality of our work.
